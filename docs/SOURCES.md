# Source register

Research checked: **2026-10-21**. Dates below distinguish a documented release date from this review date. Sources are official vendor documentation or explicitly identified vendor-authored guidance. Summaries are original; external specifications and documentation are not redistributed under this repository's license.

Availability in documentation does not establish authorization for a particular account. A capability marked “not verified” means this review found no supporting public operation; it is not a claim that no private or future integration can exist. See [CONNECTORS.md](CONNECTORS.md) for implementation gates. Implementation status per connector is tracked in [CONNECTORS.md](CONNECTORS.md); as of 0.1.0 only Microsoft Graph mail and weclapp (read-only) are implemented, neither tested against a live account yet.

## Research versus first-build scope

The first build receives messages from the selected channels, looks up every order in **weclapp as its sole `OrderProvider`**, then replies through the original channel. Support emails from Shopify use Microsoft 365. No Shopify Admin order/fulfillment connector, Amazon SP-API order import, DocMorris Partner API order import or other parallel marketplace order synchronization is required.

Order API sources retained below are **reference-only for other installations**, not a roadmap commitment. Amazon SP-API documentation helps establish messaging limitations; it does not make SP-API registration a prerequisite for the email-relay implementation. Shopify Inbox remains a separate message-source question only if actually used. The project owner has confirmed that DocMorris enquiries arrive by email; this is account workflow information supplied by the owner, not evidence of a native messaging API. Include them in Microsoft ingestion; only the email reply route remains to be verified.

## Microsoft

| ID | Source | Evidence used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MS-1 | [Reply to a message](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/message-reply?view=graph-rest-1.0) | Reply operation and permission requirements. |

| MS-3 | [Outlook change notifications overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/outlook-change-notifications-overview) | Message subscriptions and shared/delegated mailbox permission constraints. |
| MS-4 | [Application RBAC in Exchange Online](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/permissions-exo/application-rbac) | Mailbox-scoped application roles; independence from unscoped Entra grants. |
| MS-5 | [message: delta](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/message-delta?view=graph-rest-1.0) | Per-folder delta, `Prefer: odata.maxpagesize`, `$filter` limited to `receivedDateTime`, `@removed` entries, restart on invalid token (re-checked 2026-10-21 for the adapter). |
| MS-6 | [Create subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/subscription-post-subscriptions?view=graph-rest-1.0) | `Mail.Read` application permission for message subscriptions; validation token handshake; `clientState`; expiry/renewal. |
| MS-7 | [Mail API permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference) | `Mail.Read` / `Mail.Send` application permissions; `Mail.Read.Shared` is delegated and not usable for app-only change notifications. |

Implementation note (2026-10-21): the Graph adapter reads via delta, fetches single messages with `Prefer: IdType="ImmutableId"`, replies with `POST /messages/{id}/reply` and embeds an `x-supportx-outbox-id` header for later reconciliation in Sent Items. Whether Exchange keeps that custom header on the sent copy has **not been tested against a live mailbox**; reconciliation degrades to a manual check if it does not.

## Shop Apotheke and Mirakl

| ID | Source | Evidence used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SA-1 | [Shop Apotheke marketplace partner information](https://www.shop-apotheke.com/partner/marktplatz/) | Operator's use of Mirakl. |
| MIR-1 | [M11: List all threads](https://developer.mirakl.com/content/product/mmp/rest/seller/openapi3/messages/m11) | Thread list, seek pagination, message inclusion limit, key scopes and synchronous-use guidance. |

| MIR-3 | [M12: Reply to a thread](https://developer.mirakl.com/content/product/mmp/rest/seller/openapi3/messages/m12) | Documented thread reply operation. |

Generic Mirakl documentation does not prove a particular operator's account permissions or authorize unattended synchronization.

## DocMorris

**Account workflow confirmed by the project owner:** customer enquiries arrive by email. v1 uses the shared Microsoft connector and weclapp order context. The official references below describe API capabilities; they do not establish whether replies to this account's emails reach the correct customer-service thread. Verify that separately before outbound activation.

| ID | Source | Evidence used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DM-1 | [DocMorris Partner API documentation](https://partner-api.docmorris.de/doc/) | Researched GraphQL design; order access is reference-only and out of first-build scope. |
| DM-2 | [Queries overview](https://partner-api.docmorris.de/doc/category/queries/) | Publicly listed query operations; no messaging query verified. |
| DM-3 | [Mutations overview](https://partner-api.docmorris.de/doc/category/mutations/) | Publicly listed mutations; no customer-reply mutation verified. |
| DM-4 | [Partner Logistics DE guide](https://partner-api.docmorris.de/doc/quickstart-guide/partner_logistics/complete-guide-pure-de/) | Reference-only SubOrders/JWT capability for other installations; not a required connector or credential for this build. |

## Shopify

| ID | Source | Evidence used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SHOP-1 | [GraphQL Admin API: Order](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order) | Reference-only order API for other installations; excluded from first-build scope and not a messaging API. |
| SHOP-2 | [GraphQL Admin API: Fulfillment](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Fulfillment) | Reference-only fulfillment/tracking API; excluded from first-build scope. |
| SHOP-3 | [Installing and accessing Shopify Inbox](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/inbox/setup) | Conditional research only if Inbox is actually used; documented web/mobile access does not establish a public conversation API. |

The first build handles Shopify support email through Microsoft and obtains order data solely from weclapp. The `latest` links are retained for reference; if a different installation independently elects to implement those APIs, it must select and test a supported fixed version. No public Shopify Inbox read/send operation was verified in this research.

## weclapp

| ID | Source | Evidence used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WC-1 | [Official REST API v2 OpenAPI specification](https://www.weclapp.com/api/openapi_v2.yaml) | Sole first-build OrderProvider: AuthenticationToken header; sales-order, shipment and invoice resources; parcel tracking fields and deprecations. |
| WC-2 | [weclapp API entry point](https://www.weclapp.com/api/) | Official entry point for the versioned API specification and usage instructions. |

Credential replacement behavior must be checked against the operator's account before rotation. The specification link is a reference, not a bundled copy.

Implementation note (2026-10-21): the official specification URL was not reachable from the build environment. Field names used by the adapter (`salesOrder.orderNumberAtCustomer`, `ecommerceOrder.ecommerceId`, `shipment.mainSalesOrderId`, `shipment.parcels[].trackingId/trackingUrl`, deprecated `packageTrackingNumber/Url`, `salesInvoice.salesOrderId`, `<field>-eq` filters, `{ result: [...] }` envelope) were taken from documentation generated from the v2 OpenAPI file in a third-party SDK (github.com/kruegge82/weclapp-php-sdk, secondary source). **They must be confirmed against the operator's tenant** with `Verbindung prüfen` and one real order before relying on the matching.

## Updating this research

Before implementing a connector, reopen the relevant primary sources, record the selected API version and confirm account-specific access. Update the review date when evidence changes. Add contract tests using synthetic fixtures and record the outcome of authorized account validation separately from documentation research.
